               <p>
                  Shayne loves to cuddle with his Mom and Dad. He really likes to go for car rides and walks in his stroller. Every day he is becoming more and more curious. He started making the cutest coos and smiles. It is amazing how much he‚Äôs grown in just a month!

               <p>
                  This month has been full of big smiles, giggles, and starting to play with toys!
                  Shayne loves music!  His current favorite song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4sI1oFJ25A" target="_blank">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Going on a Lion Hunt‚Äù</a> by Baby Einstein. He‚Äôll almost instantly stop fussing when it plays.  He loves looking at areas / things that are high contrast. During our late night feedings, he loves to watch Dad‚Äôs shadow puppet show on the ceiling while enjoying Mom‚Äôs milk - who doesn‚Äôt love dinner and a show.

               <p>
                  Shayne‚Äôs personality has been blossoming more and more each and every day! His smiles and giggles are infectious. He‚Äôs become such a chatter box especially in the morning with all his cooing and baby babbles. He <em>loves</em> snuggling, exploring (car rides, stroller rides, walks ‚Äúaround the world‚Äù etc.), Mommy singing to him, playing the ‚Äúmonkey feet‚Äù game, vacuum sounds, watching Football with Dad, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4sI1oFJ25A" target="_blank">Lion Hunt</a> song is still #1. Shayne does <em>not</em> like when other people sneeze.

               <p>
                  Shayne‚Äôs become a tummy time champ! He is figuring out how to roll over and sit up. He loves story time. The fastest way for him to fall asleep is a stroller ride with white noise (especially vacuum sounds). He‚Äôs been grasping and playing with toys. He has so many smiles and an infectious giggle!

               <p>
                  Mommy went back to work so Shayne‚Äôs been soaking up time with his grandparents. He started eating solids! So far oatmeal and sweet potatoes are his favorites. He wants to stand <em>all</em> the time. He started sleeping in his crib <u>and</u> has been recently sleeping through the night. Shayne has 2 teeth already! He is really curious about the puppies now and even tries to pet them ‚Äî they‚Äôre so patient with him too! He loved getting to meet his cousin, Kiran, who‚Äôs so close in age (only 5 weeks younger!)

               <img class="bordered" src="images/6 Months Old.jpeg"/>
               <p>
                  How is it been half a year already?! ShayBayBay is sitting up on his own! (with a wobble üòã). He is such a great eater and willing to try any new foods. Even if he‚Äôs not a fan at first, he‚Äôll still try a few more bites - seems to be ever so hopeful it‚Äôll get better or change into something he actually likes. He loves playing with toys more and more - especially his whale, octopus, blocks, and piano keyboard. Shayne had a blast swimming for the first time. He wants to play with his puppies more than with his Mom and Dad.
