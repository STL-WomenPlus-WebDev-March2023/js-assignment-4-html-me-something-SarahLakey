               <p>
                  Shayne loves to cuddle with his Mom and Dad. He really likes to go for car rides and walks in his stroller. Every day he is becoming more and more curious. He started making the cutest coos and smiles. It is amazing how much he&#39;s grown in just a month!

               <p>
                  This month has been full of big smiles, giggles, and starting to play with toys!
                  Shayne loves music!  His current favorite song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4sI1oFJ25A" target="_blank">We&#39;re Going on a Lion Hunt</a> by Baby Einstein. He&#39;ll almost instantly stop fussing when it plays.  He loves looking at areas / things that are high contrast. During our late night feedings, he loves to watch Dad&#39;s shadow puppet show on the ceiling while enjoying Mom&#39;s milk - who doesn&#39;t love dinner and a show.

               <p>
                  Shayne&#39;s personality has been blossoming more and more each and every day! His smiles and giggles are infectious. He&#39;s become such a chatter box especially in the morning with all his cooing and baby babbles. He <em>loves</em> snuggling, exploring (car rides, stroller rides, walks around the world etc.), Mommy singing to him, playing the monkey feet game, vacuum sounds, watching Football with Dad, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4sI1oFJ25A" target="_blank">Lion Hunt</a> song is still #1. Shayne does <em>not</em> like when other people sneeze.

               <p>
                  Shayne&#39;s become a tummy time champ! He is figuring out how to roll over and sit up. He loves story time. The fastest way for him to fall asleep is a stroller ride with white noise (especially vacuum sounds). He&#39;s been grasping and playing with toys. He has so many smiles and an infectious giggle!

               <img class="bordered" src="images/5 Months Old.jpeg"/>
               <p>
                  Mommy went back to work so Shayne&#39;s been soaking up time with his grandparents. He started eating solids! So far oatmeal and sweet potatoes are his favorites. He wants to stand <em>all</em> the time. He started sleeping in his crib <u>and</u> has been recently sleeping through the night. Shayne has 2 teeth already! He is really curious about the puppies now and even tries to pet them. They&#39;re so patient with him too! He loved getting to meet his cousin, Kiran, who&#39;s so close in age (only 5 weeks younger!)

               <img class="bordered" src="images/6 Months Old.jpeg"/>
               <p>
                  How is it been half a year already?! ShayBayBay is sitting up on his own! (with a wobble). He is such a great eater and willing to try any new foods. Even if he&#39;s not a fan at first, he&#39;ll still try a few more bites - seems to be ever so hopeful it&#39;ll get better or change into something he actually likes. He loves playing with toys more and more - especially his whale, octopus, blocks, and piano keyboard. Shayne had a blast swimming for the first time. He wants to play with his puppies more than with his Mom and Dad.

                  He can pull himself up into standing.
